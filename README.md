DMTF CIM to OWL (partially) translation

This project provides an [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) translation of DMTF [CIM](http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim) and SNIA [SMI-S](http://www.snia.org/forums/smi) specification ([OpenPegasus](https://collaboration.opengroup.org/pegasus/) required to compile its mof package), covers the most recent class hierarchy, associations and most properties. However the Qualifiers are not currently included.

The [translator](https://github.com/ShiZhan/cim-owl-translator) is in a different repository.
